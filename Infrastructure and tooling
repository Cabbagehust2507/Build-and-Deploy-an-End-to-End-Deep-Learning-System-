"All-in-one"
Data => Development => Training/Evaluation => Deployment
---------------
Docker + Kubernetes:
* Docker is a way to package up an entire dependency stack in a lighter-than-a-VM package.
* Kubernetes is a way to run many docker containers on top of a cluster.

"All-in-one" solutions
Recent trend: single system for everything
- development
- scaling experiments to many machines (sometimes with AutoML)
- versioning models & reviewing results
- deploying the trained model
- monitoring performance
