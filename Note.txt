# Some Q&A

1. lmdb convert data slowly!
That's expected. 
Iteration is going to always be faster, because the keys are going to be next together on disk and in memory,
so your operating system's and storage system's read-ahead is going to load the next key while you're doing other stuff.
This is particularly true for spinning disks, where random access is 100x slow than serial access.
LMDB is going to be slow if either you have more data than RAM, or you have spinning disk storage.
